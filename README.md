Have ignored a number of files including everything int he SQLDatabase and the .docker_tmp_XXXX
I believe the best way to get the project up and running will be to follow the steps here

https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/quick-start/docker-deployment-steps.html

pull down / replace 
- /home/Snodgrass/cloud_api_sample/source/nginx/front_page/src/api/http/config.ts
- /home/Snodgrass/cloud_api_sample/source/backend_service/sample/src/main/resources/application.yml
- .gitignore
BEFORE loading images

then continue the tutorial as usual...
then sync up on your branch
